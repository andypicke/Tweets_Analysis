###Text Mining Analysis of Twitter Data

I'm been learning text-mining and analysis techniques. To practice and extend what i've learned, i'm working on some analysis of twitter data. 

I started by taking a text mining course on DataCamp (<https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-text-mining-bag-of-words>) taught by Ted Kwartler, which I though was really good.
A lot of what i'm doing is an application/extension of exercises from that class. 

I was also inspired and helped by the following analysis (seen on R-bloggers): <https://github.com/dgrtwo/dgrtwo.github.com/blob/master/_R/2016-08-25-seven-fav-packages.Rmd>.  That led me to <https://github.com/masalmon/first_7_jobs>.

So far i've chosen to use the "rtweet" package in R (<https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet>) to collect tweets for analysis.
